# M-SLIP
M-SLIP is a complete, fast Landslide Susceptibility Tool built in MATLAB.

Different operations and models can be built to forecast landslides.

It is the result of several years of work, carried out during my master’s and Ph.D. programs.

At the current state, there is a wide margin of improvement and I would greatly appreciate any support offered by the community, so do not hesitate to contact me or fork this project if you are interested.

I am working to provide you with detailed documentation, but in the meantime, you can refer to my PhD thesis (just a while for the link).

Thank you for your understanding, and best regards ✌️
